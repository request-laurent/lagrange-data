ship_history.124=Many technologies on Mistra Fighters derived from scientific researches during the Sacrum Chu Imperium period. Although hundreds of years have passed, its technological achievements are still important and relevant.
ship_history.125=With Model Attack 021 as its full name, this fighter''s fuselage has undergone multiple standard modifications and has become increasingly refined. There is a famous quote in the astrodynamics circle that says, "Once a hull frame has reached a certain level of maturity, it becomes much more difficult to make improvements through variant model upgrades than to design a new fighter from scratch."
ship_history.171=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.203=The Silent Assassin Corvette earned its name from its appearance, but its superior firepower also earned it the nickname "Fat Man."
ship_history.204=The CV-II003 Corvette, or Corvette-II003 in full, is a type 003 model based on 2nd Generation corvette technology.
ship_history.207=The RedBeast 7-13 Corvette is developed by the Red Beast 7 Laboratory, nicknamed RB7, an affiliate of NOMA Shipping Group. The RB7 Laboratory is primarily tasked with secret research projects and has developed many renowned ships for the NOMA Shipping Group.
ship_history.208=The Cellular Defender is a combat unit designed explicitly by the Antonios Consortium to implement the "Hive Tactics Theory." The theory emphasizes using small combat units linked together in a hive-like organizational structure to adapt to small-scale space engagements.
ship_history.209=A scientific research fleet of the Antonios Consortium went missing in the NGC7293 nebula. This prototype corvette is named the Nebula Chaser to commemorate the MIA scientists and their pursuit of truth.

ship_history.211=The CV-M011 Corvette, or Corvette Mid-Sized 011 in full, is a type 011 model based on 1st generation corvette technology.
ship_history.212=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.213=After the disintegration of Sacrum Chu Imperium, its technologies and physical assets were divided among and depleted by factions. Lessons drawn from the empire''s decline and demise also continuously promote the progressing of new factions. This stage is also known as the "Post-Lagrange Era".
ship_history.214=During the Galactic War, the Jupiter Industries Group, in response to the growing tensions of the war and the surge in orders for warships, established SL Shipyard No. 9 to undertake the design and production of some of the Group''s ships. The first ship designed by SL Shipyard No. 9 was the S-Levy 9 - Heavy Torpedo Escort, in honor of the great city in Jovian orbit that was born from the impact of a comet: Space City -Shoemaker-Levy 9. Space City.
ship_history.301=The Extinguishers'' 9th Patrol went missing around 32 AU away from the Sabal System Gate. The 9th Patrol is primarily comprised of FG300 Frigates with a few destroyers as escorts. It is tasked with ensuring route security to and from the Arbiter Committee and the Sabal System. The quadrant is known for mysterious incidents with missing ships and fleets, and is so nicknamed the "Galactic Bermuda Triangle." No wreckage or black boxes from the missing ships have ever been found.
ship_history.302=During a weapons test above the Sabal Colony in orbit, the weapons of a Mare Tranquillitatis Frigate of the Germanicus Corps malfunctioned and discharged accidentally, causing heavy casualties on the surface of the planet. This incident led to increased tension within the Sabal System between multiple factions. Eventually, it turned into all-out war between the Eagle Guard and the Germanicus Corps. It was later named the "Sabal System War" and "The War Triggered by a Single Missile."
ship_history.303=The Extinguishers conduct an annual military drill codenamed "Challenger." During the drill, the Extinguishers take the Pluto Wandering Brotherhood as their imaginary enemy and perform a variety of combat drills from patrol engagements and space station takeovers to asteroid field ambushes in order to improve the anti-aircraft and landing effectiveness of the Mare Nubium Frigates.
ship_history.304=At NOMA Shipping Group''s 100th anniversary military parade, NOMA''s Small Ship R&D division earned much praise and recognition. In addition to the Ruby Frigates, the R&D division also displayed the latest results of their research into UAVs with the XenoStinger Frigate. The frigate carries a full complement of uniquely-shaped UAVs, and was heralded as the "Next Gen Concept Ship." The Small Ship R&D division received the "NOMA Hero Team Medal" at the parade.
ship_history.305=The Ruby Frigate prototype was displayed in the NOMA Shipping Group''s 100th anniversary military parade as a part of the new equipment demonstration and won unanimous praise from the executives of the NOMA Shipping Group. When its railgun hit its target, a huge blinding explosion is created in the sky, giving its name "Ruby." The name Ruby also represents its status as the Crown Jewel of NOMA''s R&D division.
ship_history.306=According to Explorers'' Guild statistics, 40% of its registered members adopt NOMA Shipping Group''s armed survey ships as an integral part of their exploration fleets. NOMA''s armed survey ship is commonly used to explore ancient ruins and new star systems, Lagrange Node observations, space excavations, and many other fields. It has made a great number of sales in the civilian ship market.
ship_history.307=The conflict between the Ares Corps and the Eagle Guard over the resource planet Priscilla ignited a large-scale war. The Eagle Guard was unable to swiftly capture Priscilla, so they feigned retreat and left ships as bait behind them. The Ares Corps sent their defensive fleets beyond their own perimeter in pursuit while towing their trophies back to the planet''s surface with utility ships, weakening their defensive lines. The Eagle Guard organized a landing fleet comprised mainly of M470 Frigates and focused their attacks on key defensive structures on the planet''s surface. This became the turning point in the Battle of Priscilla.
ship_history.308=In order to obtain the development rights to the New Barnard System, the Star Libertadores and the Ares Corps engaged in battle around areas of the Lagrange Network leading to the New Barnard System. The Ares Corps initially dispatched a large number of assault ships and bombers to surround the Star Libertadores, forming a blockade around their fleets. When the engagement area was about to be completely surrounded, the Star Libertadores organized a runner fleet comprised mainly of Carilion Frigates to break through the blockade. Relying on their speed and maneuverability, they successfully broke through the blockade at its least defended point. In the end, the runner fleet returned with a large number of Star Libertadores reinforcements, ending the Ares Corps'' blitzkrieg.
ship_history.312=In order to ensure the security of their mutually shared stargate, the Germanicus Corps entered into collaboration with the Arbiter Committee to put "Operation: Blanket" into motion and strike back at the fleets of the Wandering Brotherhood. The Arbiter Committee provided the Germanicus Corps with large amounts of weapons and equipment, including dozens of Mare Serenitatis Frigates. Both parties embarked on large-scale seek-and-destroy campaigns throughout their own territorial resource belts, incapacitating the Wandering Brotherhoods hiding there. The Operation forced the Pluto Wandering Brotherhood into the remote Kuiper belt, while the Wandering Brotherhoods in other systems were forced into even more barren resource belts.
ship_history.316=The Hayreddin Clan issued a formal request to investigate the location of the large Exile ruins known to exist within the Mitras System. However, the Defender Force governing the system repeatedly rejected their requests, leading to a large scale engagement between the two parties in the vicinity of the Mitras Gate. During the conflict, a Reliat Frigate of the Hayreddin Clan initiated a suicide run on a nearby enemy battleship, ramming it at full speed and successfully taking it down. News of this loss shook the executives of the Defender Force and the Reliat Frigate was subsequently named the "Ghost of Mitras."
ship_history.371=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.373=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.374=A Privateer Fleet based in the Kuiper Belt once managed to disguise themselves as civil vessels by remodeling XT-8 - Armed Survey Ships to successfully avoid the inquiries and siege by the Extinguishers, which eared this ship a reputation of "Privateer''s Mask."
ship_history.401=When the Arbiter Committee was first established, it prioritized its efforts on restoring the economy of the Solar System. In those early days, its Extinguishers lacked funding and had difficulties acquiring sufficient military supplies and equipment. The Pangaea Corporation once donated a batch of military equipment to the Extinguishers, including 12 well-outfitted AC721 Destroyers. The Extinguishers survived their difficult period by relying on these ships, and have gradually become a force to be reckoned with throughout the galaxy.
ship_history.402=The Gallipoli Satellite City is the ship manufacturing base of Jupiter Industries. It has multiple capital shipyards and aircraft assembly lines, providing the Extinguishers with a large amount of weapons and equipment. The Pluto Wandering Brotherhood once initiated a large scale assault on the Gallipoli Satellite City, destroying a large number of shipyards and ships still under construction, including dozens of Eris Destroyers. This disastrous incident was later named the "Gallipoli Crisis." Ever since, the Arbiter Committee dispatched the Extinguishers to hunt down all Wandering Brotherhoods in the Solar System and promoted the enactment of "Operation: Blanket."
ship_history.404=Sirius Beta is a city renowned for its neutrality in its commercial and political stands. For this reason, all factions prefer to discuss multilateral affairs here. The Arbiter Committee conducted six negotiations here with the Antonios Consortium regarding ship tech exchanges and Lagrange Network collaborations. During the sixth negotiation, the security fleet discovered unidentified attackers attempting an attack run against the diplomatic ships. A Ceres Destroyer of the security fleet then launched its full complement of UAVs to intercept, while the negotiation was halted and personnel evacuated.
ship_history.405=Harper 5, a planet under the control of the Eagle Guard, once underwent an uprising. The rebels destroyed multiple resource collectors, preventing the nearby Lagrange Gate from resuming normal operations. The Eagle Guard''s 3rd Expeditionary Force was tasked with putting down the rebels. Comprised mostly of Taurus Destroyers, the Expeditionary Force locked down the quadrant and transport routes, cutting off the rebels'' supply lines. The non-violent blockade eventually led to a conflict within the rebel ranks due to a lack of resources, and the battle was won without a fight.
ship_history.407=During the Battle of New Barnard System, the Star Libertadores and the Ares Corps engaged in a fierce skirmish near the Mira Asteroid Belt. The density of the asteroid belt made it difficult for ships to travel in formation. To adapt to the situation, the Ares Corps divided up its main fleet into smaller squadrons to engage in guerrilla warfare. They also deployed their Tundra Destroyers to repair and resupply these smaller fleets. The Star Libertadores suffered great losses in the battle, and lost control over the asteroid belt. As a result, the Mira Asteroid Belt came to be known as the "Deathly Starfield."
ship_history.408=The Winged Hussar Destroyer is one of the earlier ship models the Antonios Consortium provided the Arbiter Committee with. Recently, as the Arbiter Committee has gradually grown stronger and the restoration of the Solar System has been implemented, opinions are divided within the Antonios Consortium over matters regarding the Arbiter Committee and the Terran Sphere; one group wishes to stand apart, while the other prefers the opposite. The pro-Arbiter Committee group advocates increased collaboration, in order to establish a stable Lagrange Network with the Terran Sphere; while the anti-Arbiter Committee group believes the Consortium should remain independent in its developments and keep an eye on the rapid developments of the Terran Sphere. The two groups have yet to reach a consensus. Therefore, further technology licensing matters with the Arbiter Committee remain on hiatus.
ship_history.410=Babylon Volante occupies a strategic position near the Sabal System. It houses a large number of resource warehouses and civilian ports. It was a key strategic position fought over by the Germanicus Corps and the Eagle Guard, who launched an indiscriminate attack on utility ships docked in Babylon Volante''s Port W2 while trying to seize it for themselves. In order to avoid civilian casualties, a few Guardian Destroyers from the Germanicus 5th Fleet sent out UAVs to protect the utility ships to the detriment of their own anti-aircraft defense. When the war was over, the names of the Germanicus 5th Fleet and the Guardian Destroyers were inscribed at the heart of Babylon Volante to commemorate their contributions.
ship_history.411=Jupiter Industries and Extinguishers share a long-term partnership. They frequently conduct military exercises in the galaxies within their jurisdiction in excuse of ship performance testing. By doing so, they get to display their military muscle while posing tremendous pressure and deterrence on small and medium factions nearby.
ship_history.412=Starting their business in logistics, NOMA Shipping Group possesses a wealth of technological strength in the design and manufacturing of large ships and civil ships. It was once deemed to be "incapable of designing small ships". In the past few decades, however, its R&D department has continuously released breath-taking frigate and destroyer models, which made their brilliant debut in the military parade of NOMA Shipping Group''s 100th anniversary. The Aldabra Destroyer is one of the excellent models released in the past few years.
ship_history.471=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.472=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.473=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.474=The "Eternal Polaris" Projectile Launching System, a result of the cluster torpedo attack technology developed by the Antonios Consortium, is capable of causing extra-high damage to ships. The consortium only signed a licensing and sharing agreement on this technology with a few close allies. However, its technology licenses and copies have been available on flea markets in recent years. They were sold in a limited number and bought anonymously at high prices in a short time. The Antonios Consortium launched a series of investigations, but all in vain. Before long, the XT10 - Torpedo Destroyer equipped with the same technology were caught sight with some elite Privateer Fleets.
ship_history.501=The development plans for this ship can be traced back to as early as the time of the Sacrum Chu Imperium to provide the Empire with a powerful combat cruiser. After the fall of the Empire, the development plans halted. The original blueprints and relevant data passed through the hands of one faction after another. It was only after years of transference that the design was finally completed. The ship was also called the "Last Legacy of the Sacrum Chu Imperium."
ship_history.502=Fort Dnieper is a key strategic position near the resource planet, Priscilla. Its ownership dictated the outcome of the Battle of Priscilla. Both the Ares Corps and the Eagle Guard engaged each other in orbit around the Fort in months-long attrition warfare. The Ares Corps committed many fleets to the battle, locking down the routes near Fort Dnieper and cutting off the Eagle Guard''s supplies. A fleet with the CAS066 as its primary force devastated the Eagle Guard''s supply and utility ships. Thus, the CAS066 also came to be known as the "Miner Killer."
ship_history.503=The prototype of the Io Cruiser was first revealed during the Extinguishers'' military drills a few years ago. The Arbiter Committee executives were highly impressed by its high-powered ion cannons. After numerous rounds of weapon testing and improvements, the Io Cruiser proved its worth in actual combat as part of "Operation: Blanket." A small fleet comprised of Io Cruisers destroyed hundreds of Pluto Wandering Brotherhood ships and basically wiped out all its forces hiding in the Kuiper belt.
ship_history.504=In order to restore the Terran Sphere''s industrial and economic bodies, the Arbiter Committee initiated the "Solar System Restoration Program" that includes 156 construction projects and 694 tech research projects. It fostered the growth of Jupiter Industries, the Pangaea Corporation, the Earth Development Bank, and other large enterprises and organizations. The Callisto Cruiser is one of the great achievements of the resulting military engineering program. It also greatly boosted the Extinguishers'' overall anti-ship capabilities.
ship_history.505=In order to suppress the rebellion on Harper 5, the Eagle Guard''s 3rd Expeditionary Force cut the planet''s supply lines and communication network. The rebels made numerous attempts to run the blockade but ultimately failed. In the last blockade run, the rebel leader''s Light Cone Cruiser broke through the blockade with its anti-aircraft UAVs and escaped with a handful of ships. Without its leader, the rebellion soon fell apart. The rebel uprising on Harper 5 lasted a total of 245 days.
ship_history.506=The Explorers Alliance was the first to discover the Exile ruins within the Mitras System. Afterward, the Arbiter Committee, Explorers Alliance, and Hayreddin Clan all issued requests to the Defender Force governing the system for permission to investigate the ruins. However, when these requests were repeatedly denied, the Hayreddin Clan''s armed survey ships began an investigation regardless. When the Defender Force''s final warning elicited no response, its Chimera Cruiser opened fire, destroying the Hayreddin Clan''s survey ships. The conflict soon escalated into a full-scale battle between the two parties, which later came to be known as the "Battle of Mitras Gate."
ship_history.510=In recent years, the Arbiter Committee has been collaborating with the Antonios Consortium on multiple fronts. During their 6th round of negotiations, the Arbiter Committee was hoping to obtain licenses from the Antonios Consortium for various ship blueprints and weapon techs, including the Predator Cruiser, Constantine the Great Battlecruiser, and assorted missile technologies. These ships and weapon techs would greatly improve the capabilities of the Arbiter Committee''s Extinguishers in dealing with small and medium targets. At the same time, the Antonios Consortium wished to collaborate with the Arbiter Committee on the development of the Lagrange Network within its jurisdiction, reducing their logistical costs within the Terran Sphere. The negotiations were interrupted by an attack from an unknown faction and have yet to be resumed.
ship_history.511=Antonios Consortium has been studying and accumulating knowledge of mathematics and financial derivatives for hundreds of years. Some classic numerical models of financial derivatives have been used for generations and are still raking in profits for the consortium.
ship_history.512=Conamara Chaos is a region of chaotic terrain on Europa. The region was once cited as the evidence for an ocean below Europa''s icy surface. In the Solar System Development era, scientists and engineering technicians found trojite crystal mines below its surface followed by large-scale excavation and mining. After the industrial development for several centuries, Conamara Chaos disappeared from Europa. A monument was later erected on its industrial site in memory of the great contributions it has made to the high-energy warp industry.
ship_history.571=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.572=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.573=Some external buildings of Antontas were destroyed by corvettes carried by the XT-20 during the Galactic War. During the post-war renovation of the city, the Antonios Consortium recovered the original design of the city with the help of an ancient design drawing.
ship_history.602=The Great Red Spot, Jupiter''s huge anticyclone, is an iconic feature of the planet that has existed for more than a millennium. It has changed shape and shade many times but has never disappeared. This timeless storm can be seen clearly from the headquarters of Jupiter Industries and it has even given its name to one of their ships.
ship_history.603=The ST59 was one of the very first battlecruisers in the Extinguishers'' arsenal, greatly boosting their ship-to-ship capabilities during the days of their founding. It has participated in many famous battles, including the "Recapture of Pluto" and "Battle of Oort Cloud." Many later ships based their weapon and UAV system designs on it.
ship_history.604=The Antonios Consortium was originally a private financial group. Its founder grew the group through mergers and acquisitions to acquire many more SMEs and organizations. Its investment in technology, finance, and ships achieved many leading results, making Antonios Consortium one of the most influential groups around. It was because of this that its founder became known as "Constantine the Great." To commemorate him, a prototype ship still in development was named the "Constantine the Great" at the 100th shareholder''s meeting.
ship_history.605=The NOMA Shipping Group was formerly four independent companies in the business of short-range transportation, long-range logistics, ship development, and security. They were fierce business rivals. After a series of consolidations and restructuring, the name NOMA Shipping Group was born out of the initials of four original company names. The "Spear of Uranus" research project was also founded in the same year. In the NOMA Shipping Group''s 100th anniversary military parade, this hundred-year-old battleship that had gone through numerous iterations was reviewed by the executives as a "ship of meritorious service."
ship_history.606=Our imagination determines how far we can take technological progress, and in space, anyone could spark the next technological revolution. The accidental cooperation of our three founders is the best proof of this statement. We are technocrats, hopeless idealists, and creators. We think about things that have never been born in this world. Any technology that others don''t question is not worth pursuing. No matter how many times we fail, our restless nature will persevere. This is the spirit and belief of Thunderbolt. I hope it will travel through time and space, through the Lagrange Network, and continue to be passed on.
ship_history.671=This ship was once put into service with the First Fleet of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. After the fall of the empire, its military equipment was divided among countless competing forces. The ship thus became one of the most commonly seen models on the galactic market.
ship_history.703=Large-scale supply transports also played major roles in the new Gold Rush Era and were ubiquitous across countless systems. However, their roles were evolving as time goes by. At the end of the Sacrum Chu Imperium era, as the situation became increasingly intense, an upcoming great war was regarded inevitable by alliance forces. Supply transports were then modified to accommodate hangar bays and basic weaponry at the cost of their functionality as pure supply transports. In this case, the concept of the "auxiliary ship" was born for their load capacity and maintenance capabilities, which gradually became an indispensable part of any armed fleet. On the other hand, it wasn''t the end of the Commencement''s journey just yet. In the Interstellar War, the emerging Extinguishers, greatly lacking both ships and power, developed the FSV830 prototype, a fast tactical auxiliary ship based on the designs of the Commencement, which was soon put into production and deployed to battle.
ship_history.705=The Ediacaran period was the crossroad of paleontological evolution. According to the ancient records in the Terran Sphere, drastic changes occurred in the lithosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere of Earth hundreds of millions of years ago, which set the scene for the explosion of biological evolution and formed the early marine ecosystem. After learning about this past, the Galactic Design Bureau of NOMA Shipping Group made "evolution" the vision for this Auxiliary Ship and made substantial innovations as well as improvements to its firepower, support capability, protection, and scalability. As Eschenbach, the Chief Designer of the Design Bureau, once said at a decisive design meeting: "Living in this galaxy, we must constantly force ourselves to evolve and innovate. If we stop moving forward, we''ll be eliminated before the arrival of the next Cambrian Period. ”
ship_history.801=Of all the systems under the Defender Force''s control, most are without two-way Lagrange Gates, and some are hard to reach through the existing Lagrange Network. This remoteness has earned the Defender Force the nickname "Border Legion." The NOMA Shipping Group was one of the first organizations that licensed their technologies and blueprints to the Defender Force. The licensed Solar Whale carriers greatly increased their long-range combat and aircraft combat capabilities. In exchange, they allowed the NOMA Shipping Group to participate in the research of multiple Lagrange Networks within their jurisdiction.
ship_history.802=During the "Defense of Pluto" (AKA, the "Recapture of Pluto"), the Wandering Brotherhood lost their strongholds on Charon and Nix. In order to exert control over the captured area, the Extinguishers were forced to extend the front line of battle along with their transportation routes. The extended front line and transportation routes created weak points in their defensive lines, and the fleets of the Wandering Brotherhood started attacking the supply fleets traveling between Jupiter and Neptune. Dozens of carrier fleets equipped with the CV3000, supported by their fighters and corvettes, dealt devastating damage to the Extinguishers'' supply lines. The battle between the two then became deadlocked.
ship_history.803=The Antonios Consortium initially focused on finance and shipping services, with all security affairs for its business activities outsourced. With the growth of its businesses, the surging demand for security made the existing security system unable to sustain itself. Promoted by Bali Crux, one of the board members of its ship manufacturing department, the consortium built up a fleet of a considerable size, supported by its ship manufacturing industry. The fleet not only provides support for the ever-growing businesses of the Antonios Consortium but also generates continuous demand for various research of the ship manufacturing department. As the fleet commander, Bali Crux achieved a lot of exploits leading the fleet and was finally given the rank of Marshal, known as "Marshal Crux."
ship_history.901=It was active in various engineering projects during the days of the Sacrum Chu Imperium. Having participated in the construction of the Pioneers Gate, City of Endless Dawn, and other significant structures, as well as having gone through multiple iterations, the ship has earned the nickname "The Living History Book of the Galaxy."
ship_history.902=The X10 Utility Ship has participated in construction projects ranging from Antontas to Pearl City and Free Port. Its reliability and functionality have earned it the name "Engineering Star."
ship_history.903=The X20 offers great load capacity and room for modification. It''s commonly seen at the construction sites of stargates.
ship_history.972=There were many versions of the Sacrum Chu Imperium emblem in the past. In the earliest version, it was an imperial emblem that only represented the Trujillo Clan and had nothing but the solar system on it. The pattern was integrated with the Stargate model as a token to the origin of the clan, also the very first batch of immigrants in the Lagrange Network. As the thrive of Lagrange Network, many patterns were then added to the emblem to resemble different things, including a golden three-legged crow, five major hub star systems, founders of the empire, thirteen alliances, and crowns, which completed the whole icon that represents the Sacrum Chu Imperium. As of now, people can still stumble across emblems in different varieties on the remnants from the Sacrum Chu Imperium.
